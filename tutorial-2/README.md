# Tutorial 2: Practice pair programming

    Pair programming essentially means that two people write code together on one machine. It is a very collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. While a pair of developers work on a task together, they do not only write code, they also plan and discuss their work. They clarify ideas on the way, discuss approaches and come to better solutions. (Böckeler and Siessegger)

Benefits of pair programming include:

+ Peer to peer knowledge transfer
+ Increased bus factor (low bus factor represents a risk)
+ Better quality solutions
+ Fewer bugs and mistakes
+ Developers learn communication skills
+ Developers build better relationships

However, pair programming requires mental and social effort. It is a skill that takes time to master. Moreover, there are different techniques 

In this tutorial, you'll experience a gentle introduction to pair programming using the driver navigator technique. For other techniques, refer to the further reading section at the end of the tutorial.

To accommodate learners who are not co-located, we'll make use of the [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) feature of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). For those wanting to setup a physical pair programming station, this article showcases some [different configurations](https://www.clearlyagile.com/agile-blog/2016/5/20/pair-programming-configurations).

## Learning outcomes

+ Gain experience with the driver-navigator approach to pair programming
+ Reflect on your experiences with pair programming, identifying opportunities for personal development

## Pre-requisites

+ Partner to pair with!
+ Basic python
+ Visual Studio Code with Live Share extension
+ Headset with microphone
+ Webcam

## Step 1: Get setup

## Step 2: Pair

For this first pairing session you're going to be given a coding problem to solve collaboratively.
The problem has more than one solution.
It is possible to implement a solution in 30-60 minutes. Don't spend longer than that. As you gain experience you'll be able to pair for longer on more challenging problems.

Discuss how you will approach solving this problem
Decide who will drive first

Switch roles every 10 mins, or sooner if someone becomes stuck

## Step 3: Reflect

## Step 4: Plan
