# Demo Application

This is the beginnings of an application that seeks to educate students about modern software engineering practices.

The first user story included in this implementation is:

> As a user of the 'learn software engineering' application,  
> I want to view a list of TopicsÂ which are appropriate  
> for someone with my level of experience,  
> so I can decide where to focus my learning.

There is currently a single class: `TopicList`, which has a single method, `get_topics()`
